# Third-party notices

SAMFSCON itself is AGPL-3.0-or-later; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). This file covers
material from elsewhere that ships inside it, and the terms that come with it.

It lists what is *embedded in the product*, not what is installed alongside it.
Python and npm dependencies carry their own licences in their own packages and

## Phosphor Icons

Every icon in the console — the console tabs, and the shares, sessions, files
and accounts in the trees and lists — is a Phosphor icon at regular weight,
including the generic fallback. They are embedded as SVG path data in
`frontend/src/components/primitives.tsx` rather than loaded as files: the
content security policy allows no external sources, and an icon that arrives
over the network is an icon that can fail to arrive.

Source: <https://github.com/phosphor-icons/core>

Each carries its own viewBox rather than a shared one. Phosphor draws on a 256
grid; the hand-drawn set this replaced drew on 24, and a set that mixes grids
renders some glyphs at a tenth of their size — which reads as an icon that is
missing rather than one that is wrong.
