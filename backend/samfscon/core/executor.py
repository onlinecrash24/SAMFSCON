"""Off-loading blocking Samba calls from the event loop.

The Samba python bindings are blocking C extensions and are not thread-safe;
an ldb handle in particular must not be used from two threads at once. Instead
of guarding a shared pool with locks, every session gets **its own worker
thread**:

* operations of one session are serialised by construction, even when a call
  times out — the next one simply waits in that worker's queue,
* long-lived handles (SamDB, SMB connections) stay pinned to the single thread
  that created them and can be cached in :attr:`SessionWorker.state`,
* one runaway session cannot starve the others.

Nothing outside this module may call into samba directly.
