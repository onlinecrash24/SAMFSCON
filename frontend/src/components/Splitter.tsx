/**
 * The line between two panes, and a handle for moving it.
 *
 * A deep folder tree needs a wide first column, a share whose path is long
 * needs a wide list, and both were fixed in the stylesheet.
 *
 * The width is written as a custom property on the grid container, never as an
 * inline `grid-template-columns`. That distinction is the whole design. An
 * inline `grid-template-columns` is a declaration, and it would beat every
 * media query short of `!important` — so the narrow layouts would silently
 * stop working the moment anyone dragged anything, and nobody would notice
 * until a laptop complained. A custom property is only a *value*; the media
 * queries set the columns themselves and never read it.
 *
 * The second payoff: resetting means *deleting* the property, after which the
 * stylesheet's own `minmax()` applies again. The default is written down in
 * exactly one place, and this component does not know it.
 *
 * During a drag the property is written straight onto the DOM node rather than
 * through React state. A pointer move can fire every frame, and re-rendering
 * three panes and a tree that often is a lot of work to move a line.
