 * It is in the interface rather than only in the repository because of what
 * the licence says. AGPL section 13 obliges anyone who modifies SAMFSCON and
 * offers it over a network to offer its source to the people using it. A
 * console that never names its licence or its origin makes that promise
 * impossible to keep — and impossible to notice being broken.
 *
 * One component for both places it appears, the sign-in card and the console
 * header, so the two cannot drift into claiming different things.
 *
 * The version is optional because the two callers learn it differently: the
 * sign-in card already has /info in hand, the console asks for it and may not
 * have the answer yet. Missing, the line still names the licence, which is the
 * part that has to be there.
