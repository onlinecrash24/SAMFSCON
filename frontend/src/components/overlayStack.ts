/**
 * Which overlay is on top, and who gets the Escape.
 *
 * Every dialog attaches its own Escape listener to the document, which works
 * exactly as long as one dialog exists. Open a share's permissions, open the
 * trustee picker on top, press Escape once — and both close, because both are
 * listening. That stays unnoticed while a second dialog is rare; with windows,
 * where a picker opens from a property sheet that opens from a list, it is the
 * normal case.
 *
 * So there is one listener here, for the whole application, and it calls the
 * top of the stack. Order is registration order, which is also paint order,
 * which is also what a person means by "the one in front".
 *
 * The stack answers a second question too: only the topmost overlay should
 * tint the page behind it. Two dialogs each drawing 45% black gave 70%, and
 * the one underneath was legible on its own and unreadable in a pair.
 *
 * Overlays register from an effect and deregister from its cleanup, so
 * StrictMode's mount-unmount-mount in development is harmless by construction.
