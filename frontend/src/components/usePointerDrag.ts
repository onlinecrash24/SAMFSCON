/**
 * Dragging something with a pointer, without leaking listeners.
 *
 * Pointer capture rather than listeners on the document: once the element has
 * captured the pointer, every move and release is delivered back to that
 * element, so the handlers are ordinary React props and there is nothing to
 * remove if the component unmounts mid-drag. The alternative — adding to
 * `document` on mousedown — is the shape that leaves a stuck listener behind
 * whenever the release lands somewhere unexpected.
 *
 * Escape cancels, and cancelling is a real state: the caller is told, so it can
 * put back whatever it was changing rather than keep the half-dragged value.
 * That one listener does have to be on the document, because a captured
 * pointer is not focus and key presses go elsewhere.
 *
 * Everything is idempotent. StrictMode runs effects twice in development, and
 * a drag that only half tears down leaves the resize cursor stuck over the
 * whole page.
