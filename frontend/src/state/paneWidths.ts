 * localStorage, and deliberately not cleared on sign-out — unlike
 * [consoleLocation], which holds share names and is therefore sessionStorage
 * and wiped when someone signs out. A column width says nothing about a
 * server. It is a preference, and it belongs beside the language choice and
 * the recent-server list, which are kept the same way.
 *
 * Per console rather than one width for all of them. The accounts tree is two
 * words, Users and Groups, and wants almost nothing; a folder tree draws
 * indented directory names and wants a lot. The Windows management console
 * remembers each of its own separately, for the same reason.
 *
 * Everything read back is treated as untrusted: it is a string a person can
 * edit, and a nonsensical width would wedge the layout with no way back except
 * developer tools. Values are clamped rather than repaired creatively, and
 * anything unrecognisable falls back to "no preference" — which means the
 * stylesheet's own default, written down in exactly one place.
