"""The version is stated once. This checks that nothing says otherwise.

The reason is SAMADCON's, not this project's: its v0.5.2 shipped reporting
itself as 0.5.1, because three files carried the number and the release commit
raised two of them. Every installation then showed the wrong version on its
sign-in screen, at ``/api/v1/health`` and to the CLI, and a reader found it
rather than the project. SAMFSCON has the same three files and had made no
releases at all when this arrived, which is the cheapest moment to arrange them
so the mistake has nowhere to happen.

Two of the three no longer disagree by construction — ``pyproject.toml`` reads
the attribute out of ``samfscon/__init__.py``. What is left is checked here:

* ``frontend/package.json``, which npm requires to carry a version and which
  nothing reads at runtime — precisely the kind of field that drifts, because
  being wrong costs nothing until someone believes it;
* the git tag, on a tag build. This catches the case the structural fix cannot:
  tagging v0.5.4 and forgetting to raise anything at all;
* that the single-source arrangement is still in place, so it cannot be undone
  by someone putting a literal ``version`` back into ``pyproject.toml``.

Imports nothing from ``samfscon``: this runs in the lint job, which has no
samba bindings, and parsing beats importing for a value that must be a literal
anyway.
